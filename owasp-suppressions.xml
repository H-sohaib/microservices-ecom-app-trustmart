    OWASP Dependency Check Suppressions File
    =========================================

    This file is used to suppress false positives or vulnerabilities that:
    1. Are not applicable to your use case
    2. Have been reviewed and accepted as low risk
    3. Have no available fix yet but are being monitored

    HOW TO ADD A SUPPRESSION:
    1. Run the dependency check
    2. Review the report for false positives
    3. Add a suppression entry with:
       - notes: Why it's being suppressed
       - cve: The CVE number to suppress
       - OR cpe: The CPE identifier to suppress all CVEs for that package

    IMPORTANT: Review this file regularly and remove suppressions when fixes are available!
